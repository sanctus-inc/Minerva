# Minerva
Minerva is a free and open-source suite of creative tools designed to empower independent artists, creators, and students with powerful software for their artistic and professional projects.

## Vision

Minerva is founded on the principle that everyone should have access to powerful creative tools without the prohibitive costs and without the risk of having their work exploited by AI technologies that threaten to devalue their efforts and creations. Our mission is to democratize creativity by offering a comprehensive and powerful suite of tools that are free and open-source, encouraging a collaborative and community-driven approach to both software development and artistic creation.

## Initial Components

Minerva will initially include the following components:

### 1. Photo Editor

- A robust tool for image editing and manipulation.
- Features include layers, filters, adjustments, and a wide array of brushes and tools for detailed work.

### 2. Vector Graphics Editor

- A comprehensive tool for creating and editing vector graphics.
- Ideal for creating logos, icons, and complex illustrations with precision.

### 3. Photo Organization and Editing

- A tool designed for organizing, editing, and managing large photo libraries.
- Includes features like non-destructive editing, tagging, and advanced search capabilities.

### 4. Audio Editor

- A powerful audio editing and mixing tool.
- Features multi-track editing, audio effects, and support for various audio formats.

### 5. Visual Effects and Motion Graphics

- A tool for creating visual effects and motion graphics.
- Includes features for compositing, animation, and special effects.

## Technology Stack

Our initial proposed technology stack is to utilize the performance and cross-platform capabilities of Julia, coupled with a Vulkan-based graphics rendering engine in order to facilitate both ease of development and a modern, high performance application suite.

- ### Programming Language: Julia
- ### Graphics Rendering: Vulkan via VulkanCore.jl
